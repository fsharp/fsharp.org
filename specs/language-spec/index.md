The F# Language Specification gives an in-depth
technical explanation of the F# language constructs and required compiler behavior.
It discusses topics such as lexical analysis, grammar, types including type inference
algorithm, expressions, patterns and other.

The spec currently consists of a [spec document](https://fsharp.github.io/fslang-spec/)
and a collection of RFCs. Earlier versions are listed below.
