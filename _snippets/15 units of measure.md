## Safe Numbers through Units of Measure

F# offers world-class compile-time unit safety without runtime overhead, giving you the power to express your domain in a type-safe way. This is particularly useful in scientific, engineering and financial applications where unit errors can lead to catastrophic results.
<!--more-->
- **Compile-time dimensional safety** catches errors before running, preventing scientific and engineering mistakes
- **Domain-specific units** express quantities that directly reflect your problem space
- **Automatic unit conversions** maintain type safety while handling complex calculations
- **Seamless interoperability** works with normal numeric types when needed
- **Custom unit definitions** let you create your own units and conversions with simple syntax
