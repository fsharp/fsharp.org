## Domain Models made Simple and Safe

F# gives you superb capabilities to create precise domain models that prevent errors at compile time.

- **Discriminated unions** model each payment method with exactly the fields it needs
- **No "impossible" states** can exist - a credit card payment can't have a routing number
- **Exhaustive pattern matching** ensures every payment type is handled properly
- **Type safety** catches errors at compile time that would be runtime bugs in other languages

By modeling your domain using F#'s algebraic data types, you create self-documenting code where the type system itself enforces business rules. This powerful technique shifts many bugs from runtime to compile time, dramatically improving software reliability.
