## Objects Made Simple

F# is **functional first** and **immutable by default**, but it also provides pragmatic support for object programming.
<!--more-->
- **Rich interface system** allows you to define clear contracts for your components
- **Object expressions** provide lightweight implementation of interfaces without defining full classes
- **Concise member syntax** keeps methods and properties clean and readable
- **Automatic property generation** reduces boilerplate code for data-carrying types
- **Type extensions** let you add methods to existing types without inheritance
