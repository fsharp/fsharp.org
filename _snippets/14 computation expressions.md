## Clean Code with Computation Expressions

F# computation expressions give you an elegant syntax for compositional control flows with a clean, readable notation that some say is F#'s superpower.
<!--more-->
- **Computation expressions** factor out how code is composed together
- **Custom control flow abstractions** create domain-specific mini-languages
- **Seamless error handling** with [railway-oriented programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) patterns
- **Elegant data transformations** by hiding boilerplate and focusing on business logic
- **Composable workflows** that can be combined and nested for complex operations
