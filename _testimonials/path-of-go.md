Path of Go is powered by three technologies...: an AI capable of playing Go, the F# language, 
and TrueSkill to match online players. The AI is implemented in F# and meets the challenge of 
running efficiently in the .net compact framework on Xbox 360. This game places you in a number of 
visually stunning 3D scenes. It was fully developed in managed code using the XNA environment.
