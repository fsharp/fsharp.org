Producing an [F#-based book](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~mire/FSharpBook/index.html) on functional programming has been a fantastic experience.

Using this material in an [F#-based course](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/courses/02157)
introducing the fundamental concepts of functional programming has
been a delightful experience as well. The simple,
well-designed, yet powerful, core of the language was perfect for
that purpose and, to our surprise, the transition from using SML
to using F# actually made the tooling easier for students no
matter which platforms they used.

Furthermore, F# with it rich runtime environment has proved to be
an excellent programming platform in research applications and in
a more advanced course aiming at showing the role of functional
programming in a broad variety of applications ranging from
computer science applications to more real-life applications. In
the first version of this course, given together with Anh-Dung Phan,
the students completed three projects in three weeks: One being an
interpreter for a rich imperative programming language,
another being implementation, application and analysis of a
functional pearl, and the last being a curriculum planning system
for studies at the Technical University of Denmark.
