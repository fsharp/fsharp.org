quote: Grange Insurance parallelized its rating engine to take better advantage of multicore server hardware

For nearly 75 years, Grange Insurance has offered competitive products and services to policyholders 
in more than a dozen U.S. states. To maintain its well-earned reputation and standing, the company decided to 
enhance its rating engine—a software tool for rating policies and performing what-if modeling, impact analyses, 
and other vital activities. Working with the Sophic Group and using the Microsoft Visual Studio Team System development 
environment and F# programming language, Grange Insurance parallelized its rating engine to take
better advantage of multicore server hardware, and in so doing garnered significant performance benefits. 
Processes that used to require hours now take just minutes, enabling the company to trim time-to-market 
by weeks and making it far easier for independent agents to sell and service Grange products.
