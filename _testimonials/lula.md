At Lula, we have found F# to be an excellent choice for building domain-driven APIs to service the insurance industry. The sensible defaults (immutability, non-nullability, algebraic data types, etc.) along with the power of the F# compiler enables our team to quickly and concisely develop systems. The developer experience and tooling is top-tier and the ecosystem is rich and vast, thanks to F# targeting the .NET platform. In addition, the nature of the type system moves an entire class of errors from being runtime errors to compile-time errors.

I would recommend any software engineer that cares about their craft to take the time and learn F#...not only will it make you a better developer, you will have some fun along the way!
