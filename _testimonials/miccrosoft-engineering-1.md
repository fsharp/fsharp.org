quote: In our engineering group at Microsoft we use F# for several projects

In our internal engineering group at Microsoft, F# is used for several important tools:
*  analyzing feedback on the web to look for compatibility-related issues, 
*  a static code analyzer to detect compatibility regressions in a product,
*  a delta-debugging tool to help root cause regression analysis in product builds.
