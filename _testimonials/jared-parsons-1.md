Over the last 6 or so months, I've been working on a Vim emulation layer. This is the first major project I've ever done with F# 
and I have to say I love the language. In many ways I used this project as a method of learning 
F# (and this learning curve is very much evident if you look through the history of the project). 
What I find the most amazing about F# is just how concise of a language it is. The Vim engine comprises 
the bulk of the logic yet it only comprises 30% of the overall code base.
