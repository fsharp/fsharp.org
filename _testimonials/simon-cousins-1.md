quote: The use of F# demonstrates a sweet spot for the language within enterprise software
---
I have written an application to balance the national power generation schedule for a portfolio 
of power stations to a trading position for an energy company. The client and server components 
were in C# but the calculation engine was written in F#. 

The use of F# to address the complexity at the heart of this application clearly demonstrates 
a sweet spot for the language within enterprise software, namely algorithmically complex 
analysis of large data sets. My experience has been a very positive one.
