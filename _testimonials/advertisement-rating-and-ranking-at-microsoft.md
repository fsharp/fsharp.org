Around 95% of the code in these projects has been developed in F#. F# allowed for rapid development 
of prototypes, and thus also rapid verification or falsification of the underlying mathematical models.
Complex algorithms, for example to compute Nash equilibria in game theory, can be expressed 
succinctly.  Units of measure reduced the chance of errors dramatically: 
Prices, probabilities, derivatives, etc. can already be kept apart at compile time.
