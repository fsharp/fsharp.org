quote: At Credit Suisse, we've been using F# to develop quantitative models for financial products

Building valuation models for derivative trades requires rapid development of mathematical models, made possible by 
composition of lower-level model components. We have found that F#, with the associated toolset, provides a 
unique combination of features that make it very well suited to this kind of development. In this talk, I will explain how we 
are using F# and show why it is a good match. I will also talk about the problems we have had, 
and outline future enhancements that would benefit this kind of work.
