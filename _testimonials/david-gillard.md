Choosing F# for our satellite transponder project was an excellent decision. Strong static typing and the built-in units of measure enabled our small team to implement quickly and focus on domain modeling and validation of the implementation. The runtime efficiency allowed us to carry out a larger proportion of development in F#, restricting our native code to the hard real-time aspects of the system. A slower scripted language would have necessitated more implementation in a lower-level language. Plus, having access to the .NET ecosystem was a major advantage. Overall, F# made our work faster and more reliable. If you're considering a technology stack for a scientific domain where correctness is a major objective, you should look to F#.
