At Bayard Rock we work hard every day in the pursuit of new approaches towards anti-money-laundering.  Before adopting F# there were often months of turnaround time between development of an idea and actually testing it on real data in our production environment.  F#’s succinctness and composability allows us to rapidly iterate on ideas while the type system acts as a safety net. On top of this, it has the advantage of being a first class member of the .NET ecosystem and so integrates seamlessly with our Microsoft stack systems. This means that instead of months we can often see our ideas come to life in just days.
        
The benefits of functional programming in F# have given us a great advantage over our slow moving competitors.  After three years of using F# our products have consistently gotten significantly better each year without sacrificing stability.  Our clients often are amazed by how we can quickly adapt to unique challenges and how we can find the bad guys hiding in their data much more effectively than anyone else.  Little do they know that it’s largely thanks to our secret weapon, F#.
