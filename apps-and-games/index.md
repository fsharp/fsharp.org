### Platforms

F# executes on a broad range of app and gaming platforms such as  [Android](/use/android/), [iOS](/use/ios/), 
[F# on Mac](/use/mac/), [JavaScript/HTML5](/webstacks) and [Windows](/use/windows/). See those 
sections for details about getting started with F# on those platforms.

### Mobile App Development 

These higher-level app development stacks are support F#:

* [Xamarin Mobile](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/introduction_to_mobile_development) - Use F# to develop for iOS, Android, Mac and Windows 8 development
* [Xamarin Mac](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/mac/getting_started/hello,_mac) - Use F# to develop applications for Mac OSX 
* [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) - Can be used for cross-tier client/server HTML5 development and more
* [Windows Store](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh913781.aspx) - You can use F# Portable libraries as components in Windows 8 and Windows 8 Phone applications

### MonoGame - Write Once, Play Everywhere

[MonoGame](http://monogame.codeplex.com) is an open implementation of the XNA 4 Framework. The 
goal of the project is to allow XNA developers on Xbox 360, Windows & Windows Phone to port 
their games to the iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Metro, and PlayStation 
Mobile.

### Xamarin Game Development

Xamarin provide game and app development tools for Android, iOS and other platforms. They [support F#](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/fsharp/fsharp_support_overview)
as part of their stack. 

Some resources for game development with F# and Xamarin tools:
* [Simple iOS7 SpriteKit demo in F#](http://neildanson.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/simple-spritekit-demo-in-f/)
* [SpriteKit iOS7 and Physics in F#](http://neildanson.wordpress.com/2013/09/24/spritekit-and-physics-in-f/)
* [F# and Monogame Part 2 – Android](http://neildanson.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/f-and-monogame-part-2-android/)
* [F# and Monogame Part 3 – iOS](http://neildanson.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/f-and-monogame-part-3-ios/)
* [Adding Touch to SpriteKit](http://7sharpnine.com/posts/adding-touch-to-spritekit/)

### Server-side of Games

F# is ideal for the sever-side of game and app development. For example, F# is used on the server-side of one of 
the largest Facebook social games, as described in [this interview](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=846).

See the [Web Programming](/webstacks) and [Cloud](/cloud) section for details of using F# with server-side technologies. 


### Microsoft XNA

[Microsoft XNA](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/aa937791.aspx) is a set of tools with a managed runtime environment that 
facilitates video game development and management.
