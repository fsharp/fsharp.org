### Platforms

F# executes on a broad range of app and gaming platforms such as  [Android](/use/android/), [iOS](/use/ios/), 
[F# on Mac](/use/mac/), [JavaScript/HTML5](/webstacks) and [Windows](/use/windows/). See those 
sections for details about getting started with F# on those platforms.

### Mobile App Development 

These higher-level app development stacks are support F#:

* ![XamarinStudio](/images/thumbs/xamarin-studio.png)&nbsp;[Xamarin Mobile](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/introduction_to_mobile_development) - Use F# to develop for iOS, Android, Mac and Windows development

* ![WebSharper](/images/thumbs/WebSharper.png)&nbsp;[WebSharper](http://websharper.com) - Can be used for cross-tier client/server HTML5 development and more

* [Windows Store](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh913781.aspx) - You can use F# Portable libraries as components in Windows 8 and Windows 8 Phone applications

### MonoGame - Write Once, Play Everywhere

[MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) is an open implementation of a cross-platform gaming framework originally
based on the XNA 4 framework design. The goal of the project is to allow XNA developers on Xbox 360, Windows & Windows Phone to port 
their games to the iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Metro, and PlayStation 
Mobile.

### Xamarin Game Development 

Xamarin provide game and app development tools for Android, iOS and other platforms. They [support F#](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/fsharp/fsharp_support_overview)
as part of their stack. 

Some resources for game development with F# and Xamarin tools:

* [F# and Monogame Part 2 – Android](http://neildanson.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/f-and-monogame-part-2-android/)

* [F# and Monogame Part 3 – iOS](http://neildanson.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/f-and-monogame-part-3-ios/)

Resources specific to iOS:

* Watch [an introduction to iOS app development](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/f-on-ipad-and-iphone-with-xamarin-studio/mh-7404).

* You will need to familiarize yourself with Xamarin C# iOS programming and will likely need some knowledge of 
Objective-C as well.  The [Xamarin Developer Center](http://docs.xamarin.com/) contains the primary documentation. 

* Sample iOS games and apps are available from [Neil Danson's repository](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/):
 
  * [IMBD](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/imdb) -  A micro iOS app for movie database search

  * [Pacman](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/pacman) -  An iOS version of the classic game 

  * [Raytracer](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/raytracer) - An iOS version of F# image generation code

  * [Pissed Off Owls](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/pissed-off-owls) - An iOS micro game using MonoGame and the
    Farseer game engine

### Server-side of Games

F# is ideal for the sever-side of game and app development. For example, F# is used on the server-side of one of 
the largest Facebook social games, as described in [this interview](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=846).

See the [Web Programming](/webstacks) and [Cloud](/cloud) section for details of using F# with server-side technologies. 


### Microsoft XNA

[Microsoft XNA](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/aa937791.aspx) is a set of tools with a managed runtime environment that 
facilitates video game development and management.
