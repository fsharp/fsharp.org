---

Scalability, performance, data integration and testability are major
challenges for modern web-programming. F# provides the features you need to built scalable, robust 
solutions in this domain:

 * *Fast and Scalable* - F# is highly scalable and faster than dynamic languages such as NodeJS, Python, PHP and Ruby. 
 * *Succinctness* - F# is concise yet readable and type-safe, allowing fast development of robust web solutions.  
 * *The Way of the Web* - The stateless nature of the web makes functional-first programming ideal for modern web programming.
 * *Language support* - F# provides asynchronous programming and type providers to simplify scalable information-rich web solutions. 
 * *Interoperability* - F# interoperates seamlessly with languages such as C#, R, JavaScript and TypeScript.
 * *Cloud Readiness* - F# integrates with Azure and Amazon EC2 for cloud-scale deployment. 
 * *Scalable Services* - Build scalable Web APIs and services using frameworks such as [ServiceStack](http://www.servicestack.net/).
 * *JavaScript* - JavaScript and F# share much in common and work well 
   together through tools such as [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) and [FunScript](https://github.com/ZachBray/FunScript).
 * *Open-source* and *Cross-platform* - F# web development uses open source, cross-platform components 
   such as F#, ASP.NET, WebSharper, FunScript and ServiceStack. 

Use, learn and contribute to F# open source web programming today through the options below.

#### Building Web Applications:

F# excels at web application development. Some of the options are:

 * [WebSharper](http://www.websharper.com/home) 
   allows end-to-end web applications with both client and server developed in F#. It includes
   TypeScript interoperability, mobile web apps getting started material, templates and much more.
 * ASP.NET MVC, a widely used open source web framework from Microsoft. Views are implemented in HTML with some C#. 
   Models and controllers are implemented in F#.
   The [F#/C# Web Templates (Visual Studio, ASP.NET MVC 4)](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3d2bf938-fc9e-403c-90b3-8de27dc23095)  
   include templates for ASP.NET MVC 4 (ASPX/Razor) and Single Page Applications with Backbone.js or Knockout.js.
   The [F#/C# ASP.NET MVC 3 Templates](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f57aa816-e96b-4133-ab5d-9b9b99914ead) 
   include templates for ASP.NET MVC 3 (ASPX/Razor). The [F#/C# Web Templates (MonoDevelop, ASP.NET MVC 4)](http://bloggemdano.blogspot.de/2012/12/using-new-aspnet-mvc-4-template-in.html) 
   are a similar se of cross-platform templates for MonoDevelop. 
 * [FunScript](https://github.com/ZachBray/FunScript/) - An F# to JavaScript converter with TypeScript interoperability.
 * [PicoMvc](https://github.com/robertpi/PicoMvc) is a micro framework for F# web programming.
 
#### Building Web APIs:

F# shines in the area of Web API development through frameworks like  [ServiceStack](http://www.servicestack.net/), [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api), [Frank](https://github.com/frank-fs/frank) and
[NancyFx](http://nancyfx.org/).

#### Scaling to the Cloud

Scaling F# web solutions to the cloud is simple. For example:

 * [How to Create a Cloud-Scalable Internet Game Using F#, C#, and ASP.NET](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fsharpteam/archive/2013/02/05/learn-how-to-create-an-internet-game-using-f-c-and-asp-net.aspx)
 * [F# 3.0 Azure Samples](http://fsharp3sample.codeplex.com/wikipage?Title=AzureSamples)
 * [Using F# and C# with Amazon EC2 Elastic Map/Reduce](http://atbrox.com/2011/02/07/an-example-of-using-f-and-c-netmono-with-amazons-elastic-mapreduce-hadoop/)

#### Unit Testing Libraries

It is common to create a suite of unit tests when building web solutions. A list of open source 
libraries that assist with unit testing is available here:

 * [FsCheck](http://fscheck.codeplex.com/)
 * [FsUnit](https://github.com/dmohl/FsUnit)
 * [Fuchu](https://github.com/mausch/Fuchu)
