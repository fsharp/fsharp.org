### Academia and research

> "F#...levels the playing field between beginners and experienced programmers."

 - Prof Susan Eisenbach
 - Dean of Learning and Teaching Imperial College, United Kingdom 

Functional languages are ideal for teaching clear thinking, for solving problems 
amenable to code solutions and it levels the playing field between beginners and 
experienced programmers. The first programming language taught has a substantial 
influence on what language students use when they have a free choice. F#, once it 
is platform independent, has the potential to become the first programming language.

> "F#...made it trivial..." 

 - **Prof David Walker**
 - Princeton University, United States,

Our graduate course on Parallelism this Fall is full, even though it assumes no 
experience with functional programming or F#. The students are preparing the courseware 
themselves, and one of the topics we are studying is functional reactive programming (FRP) 
with continuous, time-varying behaviors. F#, with its rich graphics libraries, made it 
trivial to construct a super-fun assignment involving purely functional and interactive 
animation of a mock solar system.

> "When F# is combined with Visual Studio... productivity goes through the roof!"

 - **Professor Nigel Horspool**
 - University of Victoria, Canada

F# programs tend to be much shorter than their equivalents in other languages, and the 
fewer lines of code required, of course, the higher the productivity. When F# is combined 
with Visual Studio, which provides help with remembering the methods attached to different 
data types and how to use those methods, productivity goes through the roof!

> "Either it wont compile or its correct"

 - **Simon Cousins**
 - [In what areas might the use of F# be more appropriate than C#?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2785029/in-what-areas-might-the-use-of-f-be-more-appropriate-than-c)

I have written an application to balance the national power generation schedule for a portfolio 
of power stations to a trading position for an energy company. The client and server components 
were in C# but the calculation engine was written in F#. 

The use of F# to address the complexity at the heart of this application clearly demonstrates 
a sweet spot for the language within enterprise software, namely algorithmically complex 
analysis of large data sets. My experience has been a very positive one.
