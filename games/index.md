#Game And Visualisation Stacks
There are two main game stack that currently have F# users: [MonoGame][1] and 
[Microsoft XNA Game Studio][2].  Both can be used for either full blown games or 3D 
data visualisations.

##MonoGame
[MonoGame][1] is an Open Source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4 Framework. The 
goal of the project is to allow XNA developers on Xbox 360, Windows & Windows Phone to port 
their games to the iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Metro, and PlayStation 
Mobile.  

##Microsoft XNA
[Microsoft XNA][2] is a set of tools with a managed runtime environment provided by Microsoft that 
facilitates video game development and management. XNA attempts to free game developers from writing 
*repetitive boilerplate code* and to bring different aspects of game production into a single system.

Dave Thomas *(@7sharp9)* been doing some work to create F# based project templates for MonoGame.  At 
the moment there is only a [MonoDevelop][7] Mac template but shortly there will be templates for 
Windows and [Visual Studio][6] too.  You can find the details of this below.
