GPU execution is a technique for high-performance financial, image processing and other 
data-parallel numerical programming.

The following options are available for executing F# on the GPU. Further options may be available in the
context of F# or .NET programming.  If you would like an option added here, please email fsharp@fsharp.org.

### Option 1 - Use Alea.cuBase, for F#-enabled CUDA programming 

Alea.cuBase is a complete solution to develop CUDA accelerated GPU applications on the .NET framework. It relies on F# to generate highly optimized CUDA code. 

* Get [Alea.cuBase on the NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Alea.cuBase/).

* See the [release annoucement](http://blog.quantalea.net/alea-cubase-1-2-680-released/), which includes links to Getting Started notes, samples and [CudaLAB](http://www.aleacubase.com/cudalab/)

* Real-world applications of Alea.cuBase include [GPU Applications for Modern Large Scale Asset Management](https://www.quantalea.net/media/pdf/2014-03-27_Gpus_large_scale_asset_management.pdf) and [Vulpes](https://github.com/fsprojects/Vulpes), an implementation of deep belief and deep learning for the GPU.

[Quantlea](http://www.quantalea.net/) are the primary contributors to Alea.cuBase and are a consulting company providing consulting services for F# and financial GPU programming.

<br />

### Option 2 - Use StatFactory's FCore library, a GPU-enabled F# maths/stats library

* See [the StatFactory FCore page](http://www.statfactory.co.uk).


<br />

### Option 3 - Use FSCL, an open-source F#-to-OpenCL compiler

* See [the FSCL project blog](http://www.gabrielecocco.it/fscl/). The project is located at [GitHub](https://github.com/GabrieleCocco/FSCL.Compiler)

* Follow [@FSCLFramework](https://twitter.com/FSCLFramework) on Twitter.

<br />

### Option 4 - Use SharpShaders, an MIT-licensed F# tool to write GPU shader code

* See [the SharpShaders project](http://github.com/rookboom/SharpShaders/wiki/)

<br />

### Option 5 - Use Brahma.FSharp, an open source F# tool for OpenCL programming

* See [the Brahma.FSharp project](https://sites.google.com/site/semathsrprojects/home/brahma-fsharp/)
