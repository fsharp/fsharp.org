### Option 1: Build Android and iOS Apps using F# and Xamarin

F# supports the development of Android and iOS applications using the [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) tools.
Both native and cross-platform app development is possible.

1. Install [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), or [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/). 

2. Select F# Language support as part of installation.

[Fabulous](https://fabulous.dev) is a framework for F# Functional App Development, using declarative dynamic UI.
This allows you to use the ultra-simple MVU (Model-View-Update) architecture to build applications for iOS, Android, Mac, WPF and more using Xamarin.Forms.
