### Option 1: Use Fable

[Fable](https://github.com/fsprojects/Fable) is an F# to JS compiler designed to generate clean
and standard code in order to maximize interoperability in both ways. It integrates with most
of JS development pipelines like [Babel](http://babeljs.io), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
or [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/). Fable allows you develop
not only web apps but also [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), desktop with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)
or mobile with [React native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

### Option 2: Use WebSharper

![WebSharper](/images/thumbs/WebSharper.png)&nbsp;[WebSharper](http://www.websharper.com) supports F# and can be used to make F# client-side or cross-tier HTML5 web apps. These can be used from any HTML5-enabled browser.

### Option 3: Use F# on the Server with other languages on the client

You can use F# on the server with JavaScript, Elm, TypeScript and so on as the front end, in conjunction 
with modern JS/HTML5 web frameworks. More details at [F# Web Programming](/guides/web/).
