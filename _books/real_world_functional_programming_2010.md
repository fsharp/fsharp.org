Real World Functional Programming is a unique tutorial that explores the
functional programming model through the F# and C# languages. The clearly
presented ideas and examples teach readers how functional programming
differs from other approaches. It explains how ideas look in F#-a
functional language-as well as how they can be successfully used to solve
programming problems in C#.
