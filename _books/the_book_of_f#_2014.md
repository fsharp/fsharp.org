The Book of F# aims to introduce intermediate and experienced developers to functional-first programming with F#. Throughout the book, you'll learn how this robust language can help you focus on creating correct solutions by introducing a variety of important concepts including currying, partial application, pattern matching, units of measure, asynchronous workflows, query expressions, type providers, and computation expressions. Furthermore, you'll discover how F#'s rich object-oriented capabilities allow it to naturally fit into existing applications.
