### Working Groups

The F# Software Foundation members actively seek to encourage and facilitate F#-related working 
groups affiliated with the foundation. 

Any F#-related group can be affiliated with the FSF, including professional groups, open-source groups
or those associated with 3rd-party commercial technologies.

The working groups either running or being proposed are:
  * F# Web Programming Group (contact Ryan Riley and Adam Granicz)
  * F# for Financial Programming (contact Natallie Balkevich)
  * F# for Data and Machine Learning (contact Mathias Brandewinder)
  * F# in Academia (contact Antonio Cisternino)
  * F# Games and Apps (contact Phil Trelford and Adam Granicz)

Two working groups are closely associated with the F# Software Foundation's mission:
  * F# Open Engineering (contact Michael Newton or Dave Thomas)  
  * F# Software Foundation Communications Group (contact fsharp@fsharp.org)

More details of the working groups can be found by contacting the people above or 
emailing fsharp@fsharp.org. 

We encourage groups to adopt a public presence and [submit an edit to this page](https://github.com/fsharp/fsfoundation/edit/gh-pages/working-groups/index.md) with details (GitHub login required).
