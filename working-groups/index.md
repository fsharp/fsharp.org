### Working Groups

The F# Software Foundation members actively seek to encourage and facilitate F#-related meetups,
discussion groups and working groups affiliated with the foundation. 

Any F#-related group can be affiliated with the FSF, including both professional and open-source groups,
and those associated with 3rd-party commercial technologies.

The current affiliated discussion and working groups are:

 * F# Web Programming Group (contact Ryan Riley and Adam Granicz)
 * F# for Financial Programming (contact Natallie Balkevich)
 * F# for Data and Machine Learning (contact Mathias Brandewinder)
 * F# in Academia (contact Antonio Cisternino)
 * F# Games and Apps (contact Phil Trelford and Adam Granicz)

Two working groups are closely associated with the F# Software Foundation's mission:

 * [F# Open Engineering](https://fsharp.github.com) (contact Michael Newton or Dave Thomas)  
 * F# Software Foundation Communications Group (contact fsharp@fsharp.org)

More details of the working groups can be found by contacting the people above or 
emailing fsharp@fsharp.org. 

We encourage groups to adopt a public presence and [submit an edit to this page](https://github.com/fsharp/fsfoundation/edit/gh-pages/working-groups/index.md) with details (GitHub login required).
