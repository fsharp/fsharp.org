F# executes on a broad range of app and gaming platforms such as  [Android](/use/android/), [iOS](/use/ios/), [Mac OS X](/use/mac/), [JavaScript/React/ReactNative/HTML5](/use/html5/) and [Windows](/use/windows/). Its concise syntax, interoperability with .NET libraries, and its ability to manage complexity of components such as state machines, calculation engines, and more make it an ideal tool for many aspects of game development.

## Frameworks

* [Fable](http://fable.io) - Use F# for React, ReactNative, HTML5 and other web and web/mobile development

* [Fabulous](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous) - F# Functional App Development for Android, iOS and more (Elmish for Xamarin.Forms)

* [Xamarin](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/introduction_to_mobile_development) - Use F# to develop for iOS, Android, Mac and Windows development

* [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) is an open implementation of a cross-platform gaming framework originally
based on the XNA 4 framework design. The goal of the project is to allow XNA developers on Xbox 360, Windows and 
Windows Phone to port their games to the iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Metro, and PlayStation 
Mobile.  

* [Unity3D](https://github.com/eriksvedang/FSharp-Unity) Unity3D is a popular closed source game engine.
