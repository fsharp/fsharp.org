## F# on Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a persistent chat service. 

Members of the F# Software Foundation are invited to the [F# Software Foundation](https://fsharp.slack.com/) team. To join, become a member of the F# Software Foundation by [visiting this page](https://foundation.fsharp.org/join). Once you are a member, you will automatically be queued to receive an invite to the Foundation's Slack team.  

### Channels in Slack Team

Once you sign into the Slack team, there are various channels containing topics in which you can participate:

* [#general](https://fsharp.slack.com/messages/general/): General discussions on any topic, including social conversations for members of the Foundation
* [#beginners](https://fsharp.slack.com/messages/beginners/): Questions and answers for beginners coming to F# and the F# Community
* [#code](https://fsharp.slack.com/messages/code/): Code-focused discussion on any F# related topic
* [#web](https://fsharp.slack.com/messages/web/): Discussion focused on using F# with web based technologies

If you don't receive the invite within 48 hours, or if you have any questions, please send an email to info@fsharp.org to follow up.

History within Slack is limited. We recommend using the [F# Discord Forums](https://discord.gg/R6n7c54) for questions or discussions where persistance and history are important.
