F# (pronounced "F Sharp") is a strongly-typed, functional-first programming language for writing 
simple code to solve complex problems. From the business perspective, the primary 
role of F# is to reduce the time-to-deployment for analytical software components 
in the modern enterprise. Its interoperability with all .NET languages and libraries 
and its ability to tackle the complexity of components such as calculation engines 
and data-rich analytical services offer a compelling story for businesses. 

Modern programming thrives on rich spaces of data, information, and services. The 
most recent versions of F# greatly simplify data-rich programming 
through the addition of the F# type provider mechanism, F# queries 
and a multitude of type providers for enterprise and web data standards. 
F# is a first-class language on a number of platforms including
Mac and Linux (with tool support in Xamarin Studio, MonoDevelop, Emacs and others) and Windows (with
Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio and Emacs) as well as on mobile devices and on the web using HTML5.

<h2 id="documentation" class="anchor">Online Documentation</h2>

Microsoft contributes comprehensive F# documentation that includes general information 
about F#, a language reference explaining all F# constructs as well as documentation for 
the standard F# library.

 * [F# Language Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233181.aspx) - 
   Provides reference information about the F# language, including information about keywords, symbols, and operators.

 * [F# Core Library Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee353567.aspx) - 
   Provides reference information about the F# core library, `FSharp.Core.dll`.


## Specification

 * [The F# Language Specification](/specs/language-spec) - The specification gives an in-depth 
   technical explanation of the F# language constructs and required compiler behavior. 
   It discusses topics such as lexical analysis, grammar, types including type inference 
   algorithm, expressions, patterns and other.

## Component Design Guidelines

 * [The F# Component Design Guidelines](/specs/component-design-guidelines) - This document is a set of component 
   design guidelines for F# programming. It describes guidelines for designing libraries 
   for use from other languages, guidelines for F#-to-F# libraries and suggestions on 
   coding conventions.
