Functional programming is perhaps the next big wave in application development. 
With Beginning F#, you have a companion that that will help you explore F# and 
functional programming in a .NET environment. This book is both a comprehensive 
introduction to all aspects of the language and an incisive guide to using F# for 
real-world professional development.

### [Programming F# 3.0](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024033.do)

_Chris Smith_

Why learn F#? This multi-paradigm language not only offers you an enormous 
productivity boost through functional programming, it also lets you develop
applications using your existing object-oriented and imperative programming 
skills. With Programming F#, you'll quickly discover the many advantages 
of Microsoft's new language, which includes access to all the great tools 
and libraries of the .NET platform.

### [F# For C# Developers](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2013/06/03/rtm-d-today-f-for-c-developers.aspx)

_Tao Liu_

People often ask, “What can F# do that C# cannot?” In this book, you will discover much 
of what F# can do! You will see familiar things such as object programming and design 
patterns. Further, you will also see powerful new things like pattern matching, piping, 
first-class events, object expressions, options, tuples, records, discriminated unions, 
active patterns, agents, computation expressions and, perhaps most distinctively, type providers. 

### [Expert F# 3.0](http://www.apress.com/9781430246503)

<img src="files/BookEF.jpg" style="float:right;margin:5px 0px 5px 25px;" />

_Don Syme, Adam Granicz, Antonio Cisternino_

Expert F# 3.0 is about practical programming in a beautiful language that puts the 
power and elegance of functional programming into the hands of professional 
developers. In combination with .NET, F# achieves unrivaled levels of programmer 
productivity and program clarity. 


### [Real World Functional Programming](http://www.manning.com/petricek/)

_Tomas Petricek with Jon Skeet_

Real World Functional Programming is a unique tutorial that explores the 
functional programming model through the F# and C# languages. The clearly 
presented ideas and examples teach readers how functional programming 
differs from other approaches. It explains how ideas look in F#-a 
functional language-as well as how they can be successfully used to solve 
programming problems in C#. Chapters from this book available on 
[MSDN page] (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh297121)



### [F# for Scientists](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470242116.html)

_Jon Harrop_

Over the next five years, F# is expected to become one of the world's most popular 
functional programming languages for scientists of all disciplines working on the 
Windows platform. F# is free and, unlike MATLAB and other software with numerical/scientific 
origins, is a full-fledged programming language. F# for Scientists explains and 
demonstrates the powerful features of this important new programming language. 

### [Visual F# 2010 for Technical Computing] (http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/fsharp_for_technical_computing/)

Read this full-color book to learn how Microsoft's new Visual F# 2010 programming 
language can be used as a next-generation platform for high-performance interactive 
technical computing. Topics covered include the latest version of the F# 
language, parallel programming with .NET 4, Windows Presentation Foundation for 
visualization, concurrent programming with asynchronous workflows, and many others.


### [Professional F# 2.0] (http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047052801X.html)

_Ted Neward, Aaron Erickson, Talbott Crowell, Rick Minerich_

This is a book on the F# programming language. The authors are not attempting 
to teach developers how to accomplish tasks from other languages in this one, 
nor are they attempting to evangelize the language or its feature set or its 
use "over" other languages. They assume that you are considering this book 
because you have an interest in learning the F# language.
